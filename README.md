- Reactive manifesto https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/ using Java and Scala ideas about distributed systems.
- Expose or use a framework? Erlang background is the key for elixir developers.
- Erlang existed before kubernetes and kafka, the problems will be still the same.
- Designing for scalability with Erlang and OTP. Chapter 13 Node architecture, secret source for scalability.
- Formulate how to do things in the Erlang ecosystem. Why there aren't frameworks doing this? Akka Cluster: Actor Model for JVM.
- Software always needs speed and scalability.
- https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-for-scalability/9781449361556/ 
- Chapter 13 to chapter 16: distributed architectures (at least two nodes), systems that never stop, scaling out, monitoring and preemptive support.
- All systems are distributed, like Phoenix apps, are distributed. Microservices are distributed.
- Concurrency (language) + Distribution (erlang) = scalability
- Immutability: property about don't change the state.
